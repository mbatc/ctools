##  Welcome to CTools

CTools is a library that contains helpful tools I've written while working on various projects. Much of the code is ripped and renamed from my other library https://github.com/mbatc/atLib. It was getting a bit beastly so I decided to split it up into smaller modules with _mainly_ platform independent code to be used in smaller projects.

For me, this library is a hobby project which I develop on and off in my free time. As such there are no guaratees made that everything will work as intended. I'm sure there are probably plenty of bugs (big and small) scattered about.
